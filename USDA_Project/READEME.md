**USDA Agricultural Commodities Production Analysis**

**Project Overview**
This project involves analyzing agricultural commodity production data sourced from the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) open data portal. As a Data Scientist at USDA, the objective is to extract actionable insights from diverse datasets tracking the production of various commodities across U.S. states over multiple years.

**Data Description**
The datasets include production records for the following commodities:

Milk (milk_production)
Cheese (cheese_production)
Coffee (coffee_production)
Honey (honey_production)
Yogurt (yogurt_production)
Additionally, a state_lookup table provides metadata about states for reference and join operations.

**Technology Stack**
Relational Database Management System: SQLite
Analysis Tools: SQL for querying and extracting insights

**Project Structure**
data: Contains all the raw datasets for each commodity and state metadata.
my_analysis: Contains SQL queries and analysis scripts addressing specific business questions and producing meaningful insights.

**Project Context**
USDA continuously monitors the production levels of key agricultural commodities to inform strategic planning and policy-making. By analyzing state-by-state production trends and identifying anomalies, this project supports data-driven decisions to optimize resource allocation, address production gaps, and promote sustainable agricultural growth.

**Objectives**
Assess production volumes on a state-by-state basis for each commodity.
Identify trends, seasonal patterns, or unusual data points in production over time.
Provide data-backed recommendations to highlight states or commodities requiring focused attention or intervention.
